# The merge_arrays(a, b) function, which is partly implemented below, takes two sorted lists of integers, merges them into one sorted list, and returns the result. 
# The function should work in the following way: create an empty list c which will store the result; keep finding the smallest remaining element in a and b and moving 
# it to the list c; stop when there are no elements left in a and b.
# Your task is to fill in the gaps so that the function works correctly. Note, that during the execution any of the lists a and b can become empty, so handle these cases carefully. 
# Try to use non-boolean values in logical expressions when possible.
# Your program shouldn't read any input or call the function, just implement it.
# Sample Input 1:
# 1 2 3
# 2 3 4 4
# Sample Output 1:
# 1 2 2 3 3 4 4
